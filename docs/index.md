Welcome to our glorious website that is committed to enlight you as a reader about the possibilities and opportunities to enrich and cultivate young minds with new technologies and gadgets. 

# Project information
This project is conducted by 4 students at masters level for a course, Pervasive Computing(M7012E) at Luleå University of Technology. Github repository can be found at this link: https://github.com/relaxz/M7012E-Pervasive-Computing.git  
More to come...(ie final project presentation and report, link to promotional video etc)  /relaxz

# First encounter / The origins
The original idea for this project evolved from the idea of facilitating education for young adults and how it can be achieved by using new and existing technologies. In order to get started with this project, a task specification has to be acquired and a strategy has to be conceived. For the first part (sprint) of the development of the project the idea was to look at some frameworks and hardware that supports Leap Motion, which is the leading role in sensors for hand tracking. Since the development and deployment of new software called Orion(2016), Leap motion has now support and capabilites to deploy their solutions in VR. The suggested hardware that is currently supported is the following: Oculus rift, Oculus go, HTC vive and HTC vive PRO. The selected hardware will be based on compatibility, portability, deployability, simplicity and usability. The next part that requires attention is the selection of compatible 3D modeling tool set that has the support for virtual reality. Currently supported game engines are the following: Unity, Unreal Engine. More to come... /relaxz   

# Short delays
Due to small delayes in arrival of the hardware and few deadlines on the course, the project took a snooze. Preperations were made to have the project in full swing by Monday the 20th of November via research on the desired game engine, tools and content. While we are waiting for the arrival of the needed hardware, the task is to run tutorials on the game engines and working on the project paper and presentation. /relaxz

# Project paper and presentation
Due to lack of work we now have an IEEE formatted Overleaf document which needs to be filled with content and a presentation which is 80% done. /relaxz    

# Video editing tools
Found a cool video editing tool called Lightworks which appears to be free. Played around with it and it seems work just fine for what it is intended, a promotion video. Now only to construct an idea! /relaxz

# Hardware has arrived!
The hardware has arrived and some conclussions were made. Unreal engine had an unsustainable learning curve and we decided to go with Unity due to time constraints. Had setup a simple test project and managed to run it with Steam VR with the controllers. Apperantely the version of Unity provided lacked the support for this and we had to "downgrade" to a previous version. The error was that it lacked a file called "openvr_api.dll". Currently running Unity 2018.1.9f1. The integration of Leap Motion into that solution did not work due to version differences and has to be looked at. The Leap Motions visualizer did on the other hand show that Unity indeed has the capability to run it so it must be some assets and camera settings that we are misusing. More to come... /relaxz    

# Progress!
Integrated Leap Motion, Unity and HTC Vive pro and made it work together. Looked at some menus and decided to go with Hovercast VR menu. Looked at some object interaction and implementation. Looked and wrote own scripts to utilize Leap Motion(Finger count). Next on the todo list, one might want to be able to control objects with push of a button and design games... /relaxz

# Progress v2
We now have a working menu fully integrated with Vive PRO, Leap Motion and Unity! We also have looked deeper into scripts and adding values to blocks and block collisions. More to come... /relaxz

# Insight
Acquired further knowledge on how to use Unity. Designed a game-room / classroom with its logic to check whether the spelling of a word or construction of a sentence is correct (using cubes). Now able to switch inbetween scenes either via the hand menu or just ingame. Formatted a structure for how a scene should be build. Produced a level system with varying difficulties. What is left now is to merge all of the individual work together. Should be fun...Maybe should have listened to Parner regarding not using Leap motion for vr classroom because well, the technology is not yet ready (or requires alot of work to function as expected). If anyone has another opinion or just would like to add something you can... /relaxz
